If the user use the exported serializer to constructed his own
procedure to do operation on his account, he cannot call withdraw or
deposit and more. Particularly, when serialized-exchange is called,
the two serializers is occupied, then we call withdraw on one account,
withdraw call its serializer, since he think that he is dealing with a
former procedure, and withdraw have to wait. Then it hangs forever.
