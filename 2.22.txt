in the first approach 's iter procedure, every item is poped from the
begining of the list, and pushed to the begining of the final list.
which will result in a reverse order of the desired.

in the second approach 's iter, the answer is generated as a pair,
with a compound pair as first item, and a single number as second
item.
which is like ((((nil 1) . 4) . 9) . 16), which is not a list.
