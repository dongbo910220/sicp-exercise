1.if (try try) halts:
     then (halts? try try) should return true
     then (run-forever) is called
     then (try try) won't halts
     conflict

2.if (try try) not halts:
     then (halts? try try) should return false
     then 'halted is returned
     then (try try) halts.
     conflict

;funny reasoning!
