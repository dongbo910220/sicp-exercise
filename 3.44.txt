No we needn't. In exchange problem, we need the difference calculated
up-to-date when we do deposit and withdraw, to REALLY transfer the
difference between them. In transfer problem, the amount of the
balances is not important any more. Even if one or both of the
accounts changed its state, we still have to transfer the same amount of money.
