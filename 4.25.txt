this program won't work, since the (factorial (- n 1)) will be
evaluated anyway, which lead to infinite loop.
however, it should work in a normal-order language. In this language,
(* n (factorial (- n 1))) will be evaluated only when (= n 1) return
true.

To be more accurate, (factorial 5) have the following trace:
(* 5 (factorial (- 5 1)))
(* 5 (* 4 (factorial (- 4 1))))
(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (factorial (- 4 1)))))

...
and so on.
