no, it won't work.

(lambda (f y0 dt)
  (let ((y '*unassigned)
        (dy '*unassigned))
    (let ((a (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
          (b (stream-map f y)))
      (set! y a)
      (set! dy b))
    y))

note that when b is being defined, y is still *unsigned, which is the parament to stream-map, which won't work.
