we only modify the assoc procedure, instead of scaning through the
list of records, we compare the key with the key of the current
record. if it's smaller, then we goto the record that is the left
child of the current record, right otherwise. If the record we jumpped
to does not exist, return the last record in our path. Once we found a record whose key is same
as the key we are searching for, we have the desired record.

the lookup should call assoc, and verify the record it returns is the
desired.return false otherwise.

the insert should call assoc, if the returned record is the desired,
just set its value. otherwise, create a new record filled with key and
value, and insert it to left or right side of the returned one,
depends on whether it's smaller than the returned one or not.
