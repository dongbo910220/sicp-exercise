a.when evaluate the expresstion '(define x 3)', Louis's evaluator will
treat it as a application, whose operator is 'define' and operand is
(x 3).

b.To achieve this we only have to modify the group of application
predicates and selectors.
(define (application? exp) (eq? (car exp) 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
