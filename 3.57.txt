Computing the n-th fibonacci number require n addition.
However, if we implemented delay without the memo-proc, we may need
exponential addition, since to compute the n-th fibonacci numbers, we
have to compute the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th, each of which require
further computation, this lead to exponential calculation.
