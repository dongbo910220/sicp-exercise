it's possible to implement 'unless' in applicative order as a special
form(just like 'if' being implemented).
Of cource in that way, 'unless' would be "syntax", not a procedure.
Since if it's a procedure, all of its paramters would be evaluated
before 'unless' decide which one to evaluate.

Implementation as a derived expression is quite easy. We just have to
transform it into an 'if' clause.

where would it be useful? maybe sometimes we get tired of
(map (lambda (A B C) (unless A B C)) a b c)
instead of
(map unless a b c)
